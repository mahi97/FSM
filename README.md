Procces Strings With Finite State Machine
=====

implemetation of :
   - a finite state machine
   - and build the graph
   - build adjacent graph
   - find strongly connected component
   - check strings on FSM
   - delete loops of FSM (wisely)
   
also implementing of :
  - backtrack checking the string in graph for checking
  - Tarjan algo to find SCC
  - Prim to find MST in order to delete loops wisely
